## Paper Identification

| MS Number   | YYYY-LONG-ALPHANUMERIC  |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Author(s)   | Author 1, Author 2      |
| Paper Title | Title Title Title Title |

## Folder Structure and `ReadMe`

-   [ ] Folder structure is correct, i.e. it looks like

    ```         
    |- 1 Paper
    |- 2 Appendices
    |- 3 Replication package
    |- 4 Confidential data not for publication
    ```

The folder `3 Replication package` contains a `ReadMe` file, which is  adequate and includes **all** of the following items:

-   [ ] It is in PDF format.
-   [ ] Description of the content of the replication package.
-   [ ] Data availability statement (description of the origin of the data and how to obtain access to them)
-   [ ] Precise instructions on how to run the code
-   [ ] Indications on where to find the output saved/displayed.
-   [ ] Software used (including software version + OS).
-   [ ] All packages and libraries that need to be installed.
-   [ ] Expected running time (even if it is a few seconds).
-   [ ] Data citations.

## Data Citations

Are the data correctly cited:

-   [ ] In the paper.
-   [ ] In the `ReadMe`.
-   [ ] Not applicable (the paper is not empirical).

## Used Datasets

*Check one of the mutually exclusive boxes at the first level. Then, check all applicable sub-boxes of that choice.*

-   [ ] Empirical with available data.
    -   [ ] All raw datasets are included (main text and appendices, including online), along with the cleaning and analysis codes.
    -   [ ] A copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv,etc.) is included.
-   [ ] Empirical with simulated/synthetic data.
    -   [ ] The simulated/synthetic data to produce all tables and figures in the paper is included.
    -   [ ] A copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv,etc.) is included.
    -   [ ] A data exemption at the time of first submission was granted (*to be ticked by the Data Editor*).
-   [ ] The paper only includes simulations.
-   [ ] Experimental.
    -   [ ] All raw datasets are included (main text and appendices, including online), along with the cleaning and analysis codes.
    -   [ ] A copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv,etc.) is included.

    Also, the following documents are included (if these files are part of the paper or of an appendix, the authors should have copied them again in a separate document included in the replication package): 
    - \[ \] A PDF copy of the IRB approval. 
    - \[ \] A PDF document outlining the design of the experiment, including information on the selection and eligibility of participants. 
    - \[ \] A PDF copy of the instructions given to participants in both original language and an English translation. 
    - \[ \] Raw data collected from the experiment, including a copy in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv, etc.).


## Does it Run Through?

-   [ ] Yes.
-   [ ] No.

*If no, please provide comments here. Please be polite.*

## Does it produce the results in the paper?

-   [ ] Yes.
-   [ ] No.

*If no, please provide comments here. Please be polite.*
